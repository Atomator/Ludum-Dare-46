# Ludum-Dare-46

> Since the beginning, legend has told of an eternal flame which lies within the center of this dungeon. To obtain everlasting light, a torch, who possesses the embers of power within them, and a keeper to tend to their flame, will bravely venture into the dungeon of darkness below. On this darkest path which you will follow, you must keep your torch alive.

This is the Github Repository for the Ludum Dare 46 Game Jam, in which me and some friends got together in order to create *A Knights Light*. Feel free to check it out at https://cci.itch.io/a-knights-light!
